# School_District_Analysis

&nbsp;See PyCitySchools_Challenge.ipynb

## Overview of Project
Amid concerns of cheating among Thomas High 9th graders, Maria has asked us to redact those scores and re-analyze the school district data.  While per school budgets will remain unchanged, we will be able to show a different view of cost as comparted to scores.  

## District Analysis Results
- As expected, the overall district results did not change very much
- The large dataset offset the changes to just Thomas High

### Thomas High
Thomas High's overall passing percentage, however, changed more than expected: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From: 65.1% <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To: 90.6%

## By School Performance 
- Thomas High dramatically improved their district ranking
- Going from third worst overall to second best

## Additional Analysis
**By replacing 9th grade scores, we have a number of new rankings**

- Aside from 9th, changing the data does not affect the math & reading scores for the other grades

**As Thomas Highs grades are the only ones affected, the scores increase in the following categories:**
- Per student spending bin: **$630-$644**
- School size bin: **Medium**
- Type: **Charter**

## Summary

- Thomas scores were improved by the exercise 
- This also bolstered the Charter school scores 
- The largest schools and the highest cost per student both scored the worst in our dataset
